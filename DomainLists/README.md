# Domain Lists
Here are two files representing trust and block lists that _I use_.

**_Disclaimer_**
I have tailored the list to suit my requirement, and I've just begun. Your environment may be different, but Squid Monitor desktop application shall help you manage these lists with ease anyway. You have an option to edit them externally and click "Reload Squid" to direct squid and Squid Manager to reload the lists.

By no means I'll be responsible for any liability to damage whatsoever. Also, please be informed that I do not endorse sites in trusted list nor am I biased to blacklist others. It is a personal setting which works for me.

For banking and payment gateways, you **_may_** see the new domains aren't trusted. Go ahead ALT-TAB to Squid Monitor, trust them, ALT-TAB to your browser again and hit refresh (I know "refresh" isn't a good thing for banking, but I believe your request has not gone even to your router. I've done it for CitiBank India, SBI, your bank may vary.).

My internet setup is:

(Internet) <==> (Router) <==wifi==> (Laptop with Squid 2.7 on Windows 8.1 x64)
